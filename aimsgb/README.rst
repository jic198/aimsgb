Introduction
============
aimsgb, an efficient and open-source Python library for generating atomic coordinates in periodic grain boundary models. It is designed to
construct various grain boundary structures from cubic and non-cubic initial
configurations. A convenient command line tool has also been provided to enable
easy and fast construction of tilt and twist boundaries by assigining the degree
of fit (Î£), rotation axis, grain boundary plane and initial crystal structure.
aimsgb is expected to greatly accelerate the theoretical investigation of
grain boundary properties and facilitate the experimental analysis of grain
boundary structures as well.
